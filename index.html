        <p id="rep-pad">An eating plan that helps manage your weight includes a variety of healthy foods. Add an array
            of colors to
            your plate and think of it as eating the rainbow. Dark, leafy greens, oranges, and tomatoes—even fresh
            herbs—are loaded with vitamins, fiber, and minerals. Adding frozen peppers, broccoli, or onions to stews and
            omelets gives them a quick and convenient boost of color and nutrients.

                <p>A gourmet breakfast isn’t a realistic everyday goal. But that doesn’t mean we should settle for a
                    sugar rush that’ll leave us sad and hungry a half-hour later. You’d be surprised how many healthy
                    breakfast ideas require very little effort when put into practice.</p>

                <p>Once upon a time, vegetarian salads were described as just lettuce and tomatoes,thanks to a few chefs
                    and other food enthusiasts, vegetarian salads started
                    to probe both our appetite and imagination, with veggies going from being a supporting act to the
                    main event.</p>
